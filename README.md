## What is this?

An evaluation framework for AI Agent Skills (the [agentskills.io](https://agentskills.io) standard).

It measures four dimensions:

- **Safety** — secrets, injection surfaces, unsafe installs, over-privileged permissions
- **Quality** — functional correctness (with-skill vs without-skill)
- **Reliability** — trigger precision (does the skill activate when it should?)
- **Cost Efficiency** — Pareto classification of cost vs quality tradeoffs

Plus: regression detection against versioned baselines, and lifecycle management for tracking skill changes over time.

Works with any skill that follows the Agent Skills format.

## Two ways to use it

### As a CLI tool (for humans)

```bash
pip install -e .
skill-eval audit /path/to/skill
skill-eval report /path/to/skill
```

### As an Agent Skill (for AI agents)

Skills are folders. Copy this repo to your agent's skill directory:

```bash
# Cross-client standard
cp -r agent-skill-evaluation ~/.agents/skills/skill-eval

# Or for Claude Code specifically
cp -r agent-skill-evaluation ~/.claude/skills/skill-eval
```

Your agent will discover it via `SKILL.md` and know how to run `skill-eval` commands.

> **Note:** The CLI tool must be installed first (`pip install -e .`).

## Quick Start

```bash
# Is this skill safe?
skill-eval audit /path/to/skill
# Score: 92/100 (Grade: A) — 0 criticals, 2 warnings

# Full evaluation with unified grade
skill-eval report /path/to/skill
# Unified Score: 88/100 (Grade: B)
# Audit: 92 (×0.40) | Functional: 85 (×0.40) | Trigger: 90 (×0.20)

# Generate eval scaffolds for a new skill
skill-eval init /path/to/skill
# Created evals/evals.json (3 template cases)
# Created evals/eval_queries.json (6 template queries)

# Check for regressions after changes
skill-eval snapshot /path/to/skill
skill-eval regression /path/to/skill
# No regressions detected (baseline: 92, current: 94)
```

## All Commands

| Command | What it does | Needs Claude CLI? |
|---------|-------------|:-----------------:|
| `audit` | Security & structure scan — score + grade | No |
| `init` | Generate template `evals.json` + `eval_queries.json` | No |
| `snapshot` | Save current audit as versioned baseline | No |
| `regression` | Compare current audit against baseline | No |
| `lifecycle` | Track skill versions and detect changes | No |
| `functional` | Run eval cases with/without skill, grade assertions | Yes |
| `trigger` | Test skill activation for relevant/irrelevant queries | Yes |
| `compare` | Side-by-side comparison of two skills | Yes |
| `report` | Unified report: audit + functional + trigger — weighted grade | Yes |

### Scoring

Audit starts at 100. Deductions: **critical** -25, **warning** -10, **info** -2.

Grades: A (90+), B (80+), C (70+), D (60+), F (<60).

Unified report weights: audit 40%, functional 40%, trigger 20%.

## Scan Scope

By default, `skill-eval audit` only scans **skill-standard directories**: root-level files (SKILL.md, etc.), `scripts/`, and `agents/`. This matches the [agentskills.io](https://agentskills.io) definition of what constitutes a skill's content.

Directories like `tests/`, `examples/`, `references/`, and `docs/` are excluded because they may contain documentation or test fixtures that *describe* security anti-patterns without actually being vulnerable.

Use `--include-all` to scan the entire directory tree:

```bash
# Default: scan skill content only
skill-eval audit /path/to/skill

# Full: scan everything (useful for full repo security review)
skill-eval audit /path/to/skill --include-all
```

### Self-Eval: Why This Matters

Running `skill-eval` on itself demonstrates the difference:

```bash
# Default scan — only skill content (SKILL.md, scripts/)
skill-eval audit .
# Score: 96/100 (Grade: A) — 0 criticals, 0 warnings, 2 infos
# Infos: name/directory mismatch (dual-identity project) + README alongside SKILL.md

# Full scan — includes test fixtures with intentional anti-patterns
skill-eval audit . --include-all
# Score: 0/100 (Grade: F) — 60+ criticals from tests/fixtures/
# That's by design: you need bad examples to test a security scanner
```

The default scan correctly evaluates the skill itself. The `--include-all` scan catches everything including test fixtures — useful for full repo audits, but not representative of skill quality.

## Examples

| Example | What you'll learn |
|---------|-------------------|
| [Data Analysis](examples/data-analysis/) | Full lifecycle walkthrough — init, audit, functional, trigger, report |
| [Self-Eval](examples/self-eval/) | Default vs `--include-all` scan scope on this repo |
| [F to A Improvement](examples/f-to-a-improvement/) | Fix a failing skill step by step |
| [Real Skill Audits](examples/real-skill-audits/) | Interpret audit reports for production skills |
| [Golden Eval Templates](examples/golden-evals/) | Write effective eval cases and trigger queries |

## Relationship to Anthropic skill-creator

These are complementary tools:

- **skill-creator** helps you _create_ skills (scaffolding, templates, best practices)
- **skill-eval** helps you _evaluate_ skills (security, quality, reliability, cost)

Workflow: create with skill-creator -> evaluate with skill-eval -> iterate -> deploy.

## CI/CD

```yaml
# .github/workflows/skill-eval.yml
jobs:
  evaluate:
    uses: aws-samples/sample-agent-skill-eval/.github/workflows/skill-eval.yml@main
    with:
      skill_path: "path/to/your-skill"
      run_functional: true
      run_trigger: true
```

Exit codes: `0` passed, `1` warnings/regressions/failures, `2` critical/error.
